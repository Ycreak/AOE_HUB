Just like OpenTTD, OpenArena and OpenRCT, Age of Empires 2 will get an open source variant without the restrictions of 1999. For example: with an entire rebuilt engine the 8 player restriction can be removed. Progress is slow but steady and a working version of the product can be compiled (at own risk 11). For more information, check the Github page.

<p>
Userpatch is the greatest thing ever happened to AOE2: with every version, new improvements are added and new gameplay options included. The most impressive thing of all: the pathing and overall speed of the multiplayer games increases every version. Currently the 1.5 version is betatested on Voobly. Also adds wide screen resolutions to the game. A must have for every AOE2 player and by default installed when using Voobly.

Voobly is the spiritual successor of the MSN Gaming Zone and the place to play AOE2 online competitively (though there is a new player lobby too). It is the best platform for multiplayer games and therefore the platform of choice for pro players and tournaments. It has excellent mod support, great ELO ladders and a competitive community. If you want to have the best multiplayer experience, Voobly is to place to be.

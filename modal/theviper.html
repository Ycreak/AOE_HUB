Arguably the strongest player at the moment, this Norwegian Viking currenty has the biggest AOE2 Twitch Stream and a staggering amount of memes, tournament wins and mastapieces. Alongside his weekly Twitchstreams with his POV, his commentary of pro games and his community games, are his steady supply of Youtube uploads and a merch store with mostly DauT Shirts.

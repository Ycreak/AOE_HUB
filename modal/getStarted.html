<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/wiki/index" target="_blank "> AOE2 Reddit Wiki</a>.</p>

<p> For now, the best place to get started gameplay-wise, is the Wiki on the AOE2 reddit page (see the Reddit button for more information). For setting up the game, check the AOE2Tools button on this page if you have the HD edition of the game and you want to play on Voobly. If you're using a Unix based OS, check the AOE for Linux and macOS buttons. This modal will be appended with more information soon. </p>
